# Implementation-of-IOT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-System-for-Agricultural-Transformation
* This project we make the smart irrigation system using IOT. In this project we use the motor driver, Bluetooth sensor, Arduino uno, Soil moisture sensor and Water pump. Main work of this project is to help the farmer in irrigation through the online mode using own smart phone. Farmer can monitor the moisture level of his field and If the moisture level is low then farmer can start the motor using by own phone and if the moisture level is equal to greater than required then he can shut off.
